# Beam-vibrations-numerical-Simulation
This project presents a MATLAB-based simulation tool designed to analyze the dynamic behavior of beams under the influence of spatially and temporally varying distributed loads. The core objective of this program is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how different load distributions affect the vibration characteristics of beams, which is crucial for various engineering applications ranging from civil to aerospace engineering.

Key Features:

Dynamic Simulation: Incorporates advanced numerical methods to simulate the vibration of beams in real-time, considering both the spatial and temporal variations of applied loads.
Spatial and Temporal Load Variations: Enables users to define complex load distributions that can change over time, offering the flexibility to simulate a wide range of real-world scenarios.
Visualization Tools: Includes robust visualization tools for displaying the dynamic response of beams, such as displacement, velocity, and acceleration profiles over time.
Customization and Extensibility: Designed with customization in mind, allowing users to easily modify the code to incorporate additional features or adapt the simulation to specific requirements.
Applications:

This simulation tool is invaluable for engineers, researchers, and students involved in the design and analysis of structural components. It facilitates a deeper understanding of vibration phenomena in beams and supports the development of more efficient and resilient structural designs.

Getting Started:

To get started with this MATLAB program, please clone the repository and follow the installation instructions:

Instructions:
General: Remove the % in front of the functions in lines 64-103 to output a function %%%
1. Please output Project Part 1 and Part 2 separately
2. For the first part of the project, the functions must be output in sequence for the results of the functions to be adopted, otherwise errors will occur
3. Please do not output tasks that include plotting at the same time, as errors will occur in the plot
4. Please output the functions of Task 14 (Eges) individually, otherwise errors will occur in the plots

Contribution and Feedback:

We welcome contributions and feedback to improve the simulation tool further. Please feel free to fork the repository, submit pull requests, or open issues for any suggestions or bug reports.
